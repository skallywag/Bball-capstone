    Title: "Rudy Gobert Earns Questionable Tag For Friday",
    Content:
      "Utah Jazz center Rudy  Gobert (calf) has been deemed questionable to suit up for Friday's game vs. Orlando as he works his way back from a strained left calf. The league's leading rebounder has missed each of Utah's past eight games, paving the way for Hassan  Whiteside to claim elevated DFS appeal and short-term season-long viability. Prior to going down with the injury, Gobert had reeled off a double-double in 18 of his last 19 appearances, shooting a whopping 68.5 percent overall in that span. His previous meeting with the Magic back on Nov. 7 saw him log 21 points, 15 boards, and four blocks, elevating his appeal if he is ultimately cleared.",

Also, Jeremy  Lamb and Justin  Holiday are available for Wednesday's contest as well. All three former Pacers are eligible to make their team debut now. It's assumed that they would suit up here, but the team hasn't officially announced that. Fantasy managers will have to wait until closer to tip-off before putting Sabonis back in their lineups.",

      "Dallas Mavericks forward Maxi  Kleber (knee) will be available for Tuesday's game against the Detroit Pistons, according to Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd. Kleber sat out each of the team's last two games due to a left knee injury. Reggie  Bullock entered the starting lineup while Kleber was sidelined and played well. Bullock should continue to see significant minutes off the bench, despite Kleber's return. The last time we saw Kleber last Wednesday, he put together one of his best games all season as he racked up 10 points, eight rebounds, four blocks, three steals and two three-pointers.",

    Title: "Golden State Increases Klay Thompsonâ€™s Minutes Limit",
    Content:
      "Golden State Warriors shooting guard Klay  Thompson has had his playing time cap elevated to 30 minutes ahead of Monday's game against Oklahoma City. Thompson has scored in double figures in each of his 11 appearances this season, averaging 16.3 points and 2.8 made triples per contest. It remains unlikely that the Warriors will thrust Thompson into back-to-backs for the time being, but he stands to continue serving as a significant asset in the DFS market when cleared. With the Thunder allowing the fourth-most three-point attempts (38.5) of any team in the league during 2021-22, Thompson's elevated DFS appeal begins Monday.",

      "Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry  Nance  Jr. (knee) has suffered a setback in his recovery, according to head coach Chauncey Billups. Nance has not appeared in a game since early January and doesn't have a timetable for his return. Billups announced recently that Nance suffered a setback and will be re-evaluated at some point. That is not an encouraging sign from a team that is short on forwards. Justise  Winslow, Trendon  Watford, and Greg  Brown  III should get plenty of chances in the second half of the season. Winslow has the highest upside of the three, but none of them are trustworthy fantasy assets right now.",

The decision will be factored on the progress that Harris is able to make over the next couple of weeks. Harris has suffered a setback after his initial ankle surgery in November, making the elite three-point shooter a long-term stash in standard fantasy formats as there is some hope that he is able to make a return late in the season.",

His timetable remains unknown and there's a chance that James sits out until the All-Star break. In the meantime, Anthony  Davis and Russell  Westbrook will continue to see a spike in usage. Malik  Monk (groin) and Carmelo  Anthony will see a boost in fantasy value as well with James sidelined. Monk is the better fantasy option between the two.",

DeMarcus  Cousins (foot) is sidelined as well, so JaMychal  Green is the only active center left on the roster. He should see all the minutes he can handle on Wednesday.
